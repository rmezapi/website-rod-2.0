          I am a passionate believer in the positive impact that ethical and intentional interaction between people and technology can have on society. Specifically, I am passionate about computers and using them to create programs that can be used as tools to help improve peopleâ€™s lives and our world. I recently graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in Computer Science, and I also completed minors in Statistics and Analytics, as well as Studio Art with a concentration in Photography.
